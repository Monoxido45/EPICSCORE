# Uncertainty-Quantification-in-Neural-Networks-for-Conditional-Densities-via-Mixture-Models

This work explores various techniques for quantifying uncertainty in neural networks, specifically in the context of conditional density estimation. By leveraging mixture models, the study focuses on how these models can capture and represent the uncertainty inherent in predictions, enabling a better understanding of the underlying distribution of outputs. Methods such as Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble learning, and Bayesian neural networks are examined to enhance the model's ability to handle uncertainty, especially when predicting complex, multimodal distributions. The use of mixture models offers a flexible approach to estimate conditional densities, incorporating uncertainty in both the data and model parameters.
